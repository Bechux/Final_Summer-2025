          The "OOPS! Random - Lucky" exhibition at Naturhistorisk Museum Aarhus
          dives into the unexpected ways coincidences and "mistakes" have
          profoundly influenced our world.
        </p>
        <p>
          It highlights how everything from the Big Bang and cosmic events to
          the very origins of life and evolution has been shaped by seemingly
          random occurrences.
        </p>
        <p>
          This thought-provoking exhibit encourages visitors to consider the
          role of chance in both grand cosmic narratives and groundbreaking
          scientific discoveries.
